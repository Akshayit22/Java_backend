Git :   
	distributed version control or source control tool
	mostly used 
	by Linux community

	why : We need it

	how it works : git store snapshot of codes 

source control : 
	like the surveillance system for the source code
	means you or someone can keep track source code

version control :
	Record changes in the code
	tracking the changes in source code

	distributed version control :
		we can do it in local machine and can connect to remote repository. clone or 

Git states: 
	change ----> Modified			----> staged 					-----> committed 

	change ----> Modified (changed files) ----> staged (git marked files for next snapshot) -----> committed (snapshot taken)

origin : remote server
master / main : branches








Practical : 

git init
	--> initialize the git 
git status 
	--> shows changed and status of repo  (Modified or staged or committed)
git log 
	--> changes in code



1. git clone url_of_Repo

2. git add .   or git add file.txt

	3. git restore --staged file.txt   ( to restore the change in staged state )

	4. git restore file.txt            (to clear the changes in file)

5. git commit -m "message "

6. git push origin master



git branching : 

new branch :   		>  git branch develop
switch to branch :      >  git checkout develop



go to master branch : (To merge )

>  git merge develop
